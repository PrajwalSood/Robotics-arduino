Codes for various projects based on the arduino board

#Project 1

Basic LED blinker.

Using the source code, one can make the led blink at continous intervals and if analog signals are used then, led can also be made to blink with a continous and seamless transition.

	#Proposed Extensions to the project
		
		Modifying the code to use the blinker to communicate using morse code, using longer flash for dah's and smaller for dits.

#Porject 2

Sonar  Module

Using the source code one can easily use the combnation of two LED's to detected for ranges of distances. Currently Coded to detect a distance of less than 5 meters (Only led in port 13 glows), distance between 5 to 10 meters (Only LED in port 8 glows), distance greater than 10 meters (Both LED's glow). Can use a display to print the distance in real time (included in the code)
